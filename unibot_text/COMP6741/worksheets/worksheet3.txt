Together with the triples above, a system can infer another triple. What is this triple and where does it
Task 2. Add another triple stating that ex:Rene is a ex:Professor:
SELECT ?uname ?uhomepage
Hint: you can start from Concordia’s URI and look for the right values to put into the query pattern.

You can run this query using DBpedia’s public SPARQL endpoint at https://dbpedia.org/sparql/.
