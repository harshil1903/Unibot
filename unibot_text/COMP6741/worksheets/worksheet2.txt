Task 1. Quick refresher: Using the N-Triples serialization format, write an RDF triple describingÏ
Task 6. Ok, let’s look at these three triples (written in pseudocode for brevity):
1. Assume Joe has a photo of him published under http://facebook.me/joe.png (not a real URL).

Task 3. Now add another triple stating that Jane (ex:jane#me) is of type ex:Student:
