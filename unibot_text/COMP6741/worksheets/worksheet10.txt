Assume that we use the following convolution filter with a stride of 2 (no padding):
1. Average pooling:
input height
map of Task 1 above, if we use the following strategies:
None,
"same", meaning the size of the kernel is the same as the input, padded with zeros):
output shape =
Task 3. What will be the output of a pooling layer with a size of 2× 2 and a stride of 1, on the activation
(4 × 4 × 3 + 1) × 10 = 490 weights (parameters to train).
Task 2. The task here is to understand the structure of the CNN (shown on the first page) we
neural network (CNN):
What will be the size of the activation map?
,
Compute again the output tensor shape using the formula above:
How many weights do we have to train?
What will be the resulting activation map?
How do we obtain the output shape of this layer? The general formula you can use is (for padding =
