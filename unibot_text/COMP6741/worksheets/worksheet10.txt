Task 1. Consider the following matrix that represents an image. This image will be fed into a convolutional
In the second convolution layer, we want to apply 20 filters of size 3×3 and a depth of 10.

How do we obtain the output shape of this layer? The general formula you can use is (for padding =
Compute again the output tensor shape using the formula above:
2. Max pooling:
What will be the size of the activation map?
Now compute the output tensor shape of the first convolution layer using the formula above:
What will be the resulting activation map?

Task 2. The task here is to understand the structure of the CNN (shown on the first page) we
1. Average pooling:

"same", meaning the size of the kernel is the same as the input, padded with zeros):
Assume that we use the following convolution filter with a stride of 2 (no padding):
