Task 1. Quick refresher: Using the N-Triples serialization format, write an RDF triple describingÏ
How can you add this information to the knowledge graph using FOAF (hint: look up the vocabu-
Turtle format with the following prefix definitions and define Student as part of the ex namespace
(Similarly, you would define an rdfs:comment to explain what it means to be a student.)

Task 7. We now define a property, studiesAt, so that we can indicate at which university a student is
Task 6. Ok, let’s look at these three triples (written in pseudocode for brevity):
Add the triple:

1. Assume Joe has a photo of him published under http://facebook.me/joe.png (not a real URL).

Are these syntactically legal triples? (Spoiler alert: yes, we could write each of them using perfectly fine
