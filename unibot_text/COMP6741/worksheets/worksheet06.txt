Task 5. Here are three different systems that classified 500 data items:

Task 2. Here is a dataset of documents with two attributes, to be grouped into two clusters. Apply

You can now auto-assign a tag to the new document based on a majority vote of the k nearest neighbors.
To find the predicted rating for Movie #4, first find the two nearest neighbors (i.e., k = 2), using the same
