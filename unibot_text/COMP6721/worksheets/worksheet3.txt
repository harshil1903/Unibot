So, when your system sounds the fraud alarm, in how many percent of the cases was it a false alarm?

Worksheet #3: Näıve Bayes Classifier
In your company, 0.01% of all transactions are fraudulent, i.e., P (B) = 0.0001. Event A is “system detected fraud”.
So, the new email is:

So, tomorrow’s weather will be:

AI Weather Prediction. Now we can build a weather-predicting AI using Bayes’ theorem:

Is this email spam or ham? Apply Bayes’ Algorithm to find out which class has a higher probability:
P (B|A) · P (A)
P (A|B) =

Today we observe an average sunset (E2). What kind of weather will we have tomorrow? Compute the probabilities
Hint: You will need P (A), which you can compute using P (A) = P (A|B) · P (B) + P (A|B) · P (B).
