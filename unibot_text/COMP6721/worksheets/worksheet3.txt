Joint Probabilities. Given the following joint probability distribution:

AI Weather Prediction. Now we can build a weather-predicting AI using Bayes’ theorem:
,with P (E2) = P (H1) · P (E2|H1) + P (H2) · P (E2|H2) + P (H3) · P (E2|H3) = 0.31
Machine Learning System Evaluation. Consider the results from three different ML systems on a binary classification

In your company, 0.01% of all transactions are fraudulent, i.e., P (B) = 0.0001. Event A is “system detected fraud”.
