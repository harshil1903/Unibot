Assume that we use the following convolution filter with a stride of 2 (no padding):
1. Average pooling:
where h is a matrix of size (1 × 5), h = [ ]
2. Now to compute the result for h, the sigmoid function σ(x) = 1
is applied to the pre-activation
the autoencoder. You can assume an input value of 1 for the biases, and all the weights (including the

1. First, compute the pre-activation function (the net), by multiplying the input and weights, plus the
bias. Rather than listing every weight as on the previous worksheet, we now use matrix notation:1
Autoencoder Activation. Assume that we use an autoencoder with the following hyperparameters: the
